# 🖥️ Projects:

🏰 <a href="https://github.com/PaulJur/Tower-Defense" rel="nofollow">Tower Defense - Porftender TD</a>
Portfender TD, my final university project, is a Unity-based randomized wave Tower Defense game scripted in C#. The game leverages Unity's features for dynamic gameplay, requiring players to adapt strategies to unpredictable waves. During a 30-second grace period, players make critical decisions, choosing between strategic tower-building or investment in three stocks, each governed by its risk-reward algorithm. This project underscores my practical experience with Unity Engine, proficiency in C# scripting, and technical skills in creating an engaging and adaptable gaming experience

📱 <a href="https://github.com/PaulJur/3D-Phone-Rolling-Ball-Puzzle" rel="nofollow">3D Phone Ball Puzzle Game</a>
Explore an Android gaming project integrating two challenges developed using Unity Engine and C# scripting. In the 3D Phone Rolling Ball Puzzle, utilize your device's gyro for navigation across five progressively challenging levels. Employ strategic tilting to overcome traps and narrow pathways, showcasing control finesse. Unlock skins like the exclusive Ruby skin achieved on level 4. Fire, Green Magma, Lava, and Default purple skins are algorithmically generated through stable diffusion. Save progress on your Android device for persistent level access. 

🗃️ <a href="https://github.com/PaulJur/Delivery-Hell" rel="nofollow">Delivery Hell</a>
At my first internship with Kiberuostas, I developed a 2D puzzle game using C# in Unity. The game, created as an ad, features three levels of increasing difficulty. The company was pleased with the final product, highlighting my ability to deliver a requested and functional game.

⚔️ <a href="https://github.com/PaulJur/TurnBasedGame" rel="nofollow">Turn-Based Text-Based RPG</a>
This C#-based text RPG features a random encounter system with simple AI for monsters, deciding between Attack, Heal, or Defend actions. The game includes an inventory system, leveling, and equipment management with a single sword and healing potions for now. Notably, a JSON data saving and loading system has been implemented. The game incorporates monster scaling, adjusting difficulty as players level up. There are four distinct monster types, each capable of dodging player attacks. The game also includes one boss encounter, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to the gameplay.
